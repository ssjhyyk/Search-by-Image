# Search by Image
 Search by image is a feature that allows users to search the Internet using an image as the search query instead of text. This can be useful in cases where the user is unable to identify the text or content of an image, or if they are looking for similar images to a particular image. Search by image can be performed using a variety of tools, including search engines like Google and Bing, as well as specialized image search tools like TinEye and Reverse Image Search. To use search by image, the user can either upload an image file from their device or provide the URL of an image that is already online. The search tool will then analyze the image and attempt to match it with other images or related content on the Internet. The results of the search may include websites that contain the image, as well as other images that are visually similar to the search image.
